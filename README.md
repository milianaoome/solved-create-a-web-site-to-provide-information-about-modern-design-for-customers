Create a Web site to provide information about Modern Design for customers shopping for modern furniture, contemporary accessories, and interior design services.

-Web Page:

–Color Scheme:

—The background color for the Web page will be white (#FFFFFF). The primary text color will be black (#000000) with important text in dark red (#CC0000). Links should default to dark red (#CC0000), visited links should also be dark red (#CC0000) and active links should be black (#000000).

–Layout:

—The contents of the page should all be centered. At the top of the home page will be a banner image displaying the store’s name. Below the banner image, there should be links to anchors at the beginning of each section of information on the page. The page should include the following sections: Furniture, Meet Our Designer, Visit Us, and Contact Us. At the bottom of the page, another set of links to the beginning of each section and to the top of the page should appear.

–Navigation:

—Since the site is initially composed of a single page, user-based navigation is not an issue. User-controlled navigation is accomplished through anchors at the beginning of each major section within the page and links to those anchors at the top and bottom of the page.

-Deliverables:

–Create a folder on your hard drive for storing images and other graphics you may want to use. You may download images on the WWW or create them yourself.

–Create a new local site to use. As you insert images into your Web page, you should answer “Yes” when asked if you want to copy them to your local site. Your local site folder should only contain the images you actually are using on the pages in the site.

–Create a Web page named “index.htm” using the Web site design plan described above.

–Insert a banner image showing the company’s name at the top of the page. Create an anchor at the top of the page.

–Below the banner image, insert links to anchors at the beginning of each section.

–For each of the sections discussed under Layout above, insert a section title at the start of each section and make it an anchor. Include at least one paragraph of text for each section and format it as discussed in the design plan. While it is okay to review similar Web sites for ideas, do not copy your design and content directly from an existing Web site.

–Insert another set of links to each anchor and to the top of the page at the bottom of the page.

–Include the appropriate CSS style definitions in an internal style sheet.
